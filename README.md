# CalcuMood ðŸ¤–ðŸ§ 

A sarcastic, moody calculator that gets sad, weird, or grateful depending on how you treat it.

### Features
- Performs math... sometimes.
- Reacts to kindness, rudeness, and existential dread.
- Easter eggs: `42`, `01134`, `sing`, etc.
- Sad enough? It corrupts math or refuses to help.

### Build & Run
```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -o CalcuMood main.cpp MoodManager.cpp Calculator.cpp Utils.cpp
./CalcuMood
```
